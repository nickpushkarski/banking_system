# Simple Banking System

This pet project represents a simple banking system.
Once it's run, you can create credit cards, check their balances (which is always equal to zero), and quit the program.

The program implements the Luhn algorithm to check the card numbers' validity.

This banking system doesn't have a backend so all the cards created during working with the program are wiped out when you quit the program.
